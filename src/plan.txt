Your Task
Here, you’ll build an app that feels a whole lot like a photo tagging app.
 You’ll start with a large photograph which contains several elements the user is meant to find, e.g. Waldo, The Wizard, Wilma etc… name your own if you’d like to use your own photos.
  The user will make selections for each character and they will get feedback on whether they are correct or not.

To start with, you’ll need to choose a photo and identify where exactly each person is to start with and save that to your database. When the user clicks the photo,
 it should place a targeting box around the portion of the photo where the user has clicked. That box should contain a list of possible characters.

When the user selects one of these characters, you should check with your Backend to see if that character is actually within the targeting box.
 Provide the user with appropriate feedback (e.g. if wrong, an error message). If correct, place a marker on the photo in the character’s location. In either case, remove the targeting box until the user clicks again.

Keep track of how long it takes between when the photo is first loaded and when the user finally identifies all characters (do this on the server side otherwise the user could hack their score).
Note: do this if you’re using rails as your backend. Firebase users don’t need to add a timer on the backend, instead add one on the front end. Once a round is complete,
ask the user for his/her name and record that time. This will get a bit tricky since you’ll have anonymous users you need to keep track of!

Firebase
    database
        Stores position and character

app
    Server side counter for time Once a round is complete, ask the user for his/her name and record that time. 
    Div
        Background img
        On click - function () that takes position and opens Option-box component -> after character is selected sends coords and character to compare with database -> if correct
        component character turns gray and is no longer available to select // if incorrect display feedback
